Task 05: Network Packet Analyzer.

This is a Python project for the Prodigy InfoTech Cyber Security Internship.

The program creates a basic network traffic monitor and analysis tool. This project provides hands-on experience in network forensics and monitoring.

Key features:

The tool uses the scapy library to capture raw packets traveling across a selected network interface.

It extracts and displays critical network metadata for each captured packet, including Source IP, Destination IP, and Protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP).

It provides a snippet of the packet's payload, demonstrating how to view the underlying data being transferred.

It helps distinguish between local and remote traffic, foundational for identifying suspicious communication.

Technology used:

Python

scapy library
